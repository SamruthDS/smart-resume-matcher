        "\n",
        "This Google Colaboratory notebook presents a Unified Resume Matching Application, designed to streamline the job application process for both recruiters and job seekers. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the application efficiently compares resumes against job descriptions to identify the best matches.\n",

        "**üåü Key Features:**\n",
        "**Dual-Mode Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recruiter Mode:** Upload multiple resumes (PDF/DOCX) and a job description (predefined or custom) to get a ranked list of top-matching candidates and a downloadable CSV report for bulk analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Job Seeker Mode:** Upload your resume (or paste text) and a job description (predefined or custom) to instantly receive a personalized match score, helping you tailor your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Robust Text Extraction:** Seamlessly extracts text from both .pdf and .docx file formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Intelligent Resume Validation:** Employs a heuristic to intelligently filter out non-resume documents (e.g., research papers, certificates) based on their content, ensuring only relevant documents are processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customizable Job Descriptions:** Offers the flexibility to use predefined job roles or input custom job descriptions for highly specific matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:** Utilizes industry-standard NLP techniques for effective textual similarity comparison.\n",
